  <h2>My projects</h2>
  <p>Since I started this training have done several small projects and are done with HTML and CSS being the basic blocks of programming. Lets look at a few:</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>Hello-World</li>
    <p>My first HTML project to upload to git. Man this was confusing! <br> Using this project I learned the use of Git as a code tracking platform. It also helped me practice use of branches in Git. <br> to get a sneak preview of the project use the link below.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/nkmakau/hello-world" target="_blank"><span id="link">Hello-World Project</span></a></p>

    <li>Cookie-Recipe</li>
    <p>Decided to do a cookie recipe to try out lists. <br> On git I learned on how to add a license and a readme directly. The readme did not have much for it was a first trys X. Checkout the project.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/nkmakau/cookie-recipe" target="_blank">Cookie-Recipe</a>

    <li>Bobo Pet</li>
    <p>Bobo is a cute little Elephant and wanted to have a website to showcase her life and buddies.</p>
    <p>With this project things got a little bit more interesting! This brought in the concept of CSS, using images, and adding linked pages to a project. <br> It also brought about more git knowldge on branching, doing pull requests and merging. I learned about the use on Markdown to do readme and created a more detailed readme this time. <br> Lastly it introduced us to git pages. Checkout the links below.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/nkmakau/bobo-pet" target="_blank">Git repo for bobo</a> and <a href="https://nkmakau.github.io/bobo-pet/">Git pages for Bobo</a></p>

    <li>Happy Trails</li>
    <p>Website showcasing Happy Trails Travel Agency Destinations. Its done with HTML and CSS was used also to showcase use of the float tag. <br> The project also borrowed heavily from bobo pet project. Checkout the git pages</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Why I wanted to do programming?</h2>
    <div id="aboutz" class="column">
      <h3>Make my Life Easier</h3>
      <p>Learning how to become a programmer will teach me the even a few simple lines of code can do so much to make life easier for me. If something will only work when a few buttons are pushed, program my smartphone to do it with one tap. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="abouty" class="column">
      <h3 >Learn Persistence</h3>
      <p>When I begin to learn how to program, I wlil begin to see all problems in the light of their solutions and my brain begins to function in that way. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="aboutw" class="column">
      <h3>An Amazing Career</h3>
      <p>This is probably one of the very best reasons to become a computer programmer – there are so many jobs available to me. The world is turning digital, we are increasingly becoming more reliant as a society on technology and as a result, there are more and more computer programming jobs to choose from and this will not change in the foreseeable future.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="aboute" class="column">
      <h3>Think Like a Programmer</h3>
      <p>When I can think like a computer programmer does, I will start relating that to my real life. Most people will not be able to see the connection, let alone understand it but I will, when I start learning to program.</p>
