      <h3>Make my Life Easier</h3>
      <p>Learning how to become a programmer will teach me the even a few simple lines of code can do so much to make life easier for me. If something will only work when a few buttons are pushed, program my smartphone to do it with one tap. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="abouty" class="column">
      <h3 >Learn Persistence</h3>
      <p>When I begin to learn how to program, I wlil begin to see all problems in the light of their solutions and my brain begins to function in that way. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="aboutw" class="column">
      <h3>An Amazing Career</h3>
      <p>This is probably one of the very best reasons to become a computer programmer – there are so many jobs available to me. The world is turning digital, we are increasingly becoming more reliant as a society on technology and as a result, there are more and more computer programming jobs to choose from and this will not change in the foreseeable future.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="aboute" class="column">
      <h3>Think Like a Programmer</h3>
      <p>When I can think like a computer programmer does, I will start relating that to my real life. Most people will not be able to see the connection, let alone understand it but I will, when I start learning to program.</p>
